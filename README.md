## MODULE 8: Journal


**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem I was trying to solve was to build an application for ABCU's computer science advisors to access course information for students. The application would utilize algorithms and data structures to efficiently traverse the provided course list with prerequisities. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I approached the problem from the view point of a consumer. Technology IS the future. Why do we use technology? We use technology to automate tasks that would normally take a long time to develop and implement. We value speed, accuracy and efficiency. While this project only focused on a few courses, you have to consider scalability in your design. Obviously, in a real-world scenario there are a ton of courses and in some cases the requirements in the course catalog might change to accommodate the changing landscape in industry standards. Choosing the right data structure can help manage the way data is stored and retrieved and improve performance. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I think the one thing I relied on is logic and google search. My biggest issue was that I was feeling like I was going through imposter syndrome. I was developing applications but not really understanding what was going on under the hood. It is important for me to build on my logic because sometimes reinventing the wheel can lead to new discoveries about how to solve specific problems.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
The work I have done on this project has allowed me to think more critically about how data is utilized and that design isn't just visual elements on a page but much more basic like memory usage, performance and efficiency.  

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I think my work on this project has helped me re-evaluate my own personal projects. Not only am I focused on the visual aspect of my application but also it's internal structure. I'm currently building a catalog of collector's items that I have acquired through out the years and the biggest issue was how to create the database and which method(s) to use to traverse the data.
